					<h1 class="text-center">The Buying Cycle</h1>
					<br>
					<p>If you want to sell something, it’s useful to think about how people buy. Not every product is the same, but generally they follow a series of steps that look like this.</p>
        			<p>The goal is the match the right communication with the consumer no matter where they are in the Buying Cycle. It’s a useful schematic for building a marketing program that’s based around the consumer.</p>

						<dt>No Awareness</dt>
						<dd>In the beginning, there is darkness.  Customers don’t know anything about you, or even about your industry.  They just don’t care, because they are not in the market for your product.</dd>
						<dt>Awareness</dt>
						<dd>The customer perceives a need for your product or class of product.  “Huh, I could really use a new phone.”</dd>
						<dt>Active Interest</dt>
						<dd>The customer is now thinking about purchasing a product from you or a competitor.  “I could really use a new phone NOW.”</dd>
						<dt>Research</dt>
						<dd>The customer is interested enough to compare your product to your competitors, with the expectation of making a purchase.</dd>
						<dt>Trial purchase</dt>
						<dd>Eureka!  The customer buys something.</dd>
					</dl>
					
					<p>One might think this is the end of the process, but it’s actually the beginning of a new phase.  Now we are trying to move our target from “buyer” to “customer.” </p>
					
					<p>I call this phase the “tender time” -- the customer wonders “did I make the right choice?” For smart marketers, it’s the ideal opportunity to build loyalty.  (someone from American Express once told me that their most loyal customers are those who’ve had problems with their cards, because they experience AMEX’s customer service first hand.)</p>
					<p>The next 3 stages are levels of usage and they reflect the loyalty of your customer.  The best way to explain this is through an example:</p>
					<dl class="dl-horizontal">
						<dt>Shared Usage</dt>
						<dd>Let’s say you sell toothpaste.  At Shared Usage, your customer will buy your toothpaste if it’s cheapest or on sale.</dd>
						<dt>Preferred Usage</dt>
						<dd>At this stage, your customer will buy your toothpaste even if it’s more expensive.</dd>
						<dt>Exclusive Usage</dt>
						<dd>The Holy Grail.  With Exclusive Usage, your customer will buy your brand only.  If the store is out of your toothpaste, they’ll go to another store.</dd>
					</dl>
					<p>Cool.  But why do we care?  Because the Buying Cycle helps us create a marketing strategy.  Since customers at different stages in the Buying Cycle care about different things, we need to make sure we give them the information that moves them to the next stage.  </p>
					<p>This is crucial – zillions of marketing dollars are wasted on programs that will never accomplish the goal.  If your objective is to increase sales from existing customers, advertising is a poor choice, for example</p>
					<p>So take a look at the Buying Cycle chart now – I have mapped marketing elements designed to work at each stage.</p>
					<p>Please note that we may not know where any individual consumer is in the Buying Cycle.  That’s not important for strategizing.  What is important is making sure the customer gets the information they need, when and how they need it.  And the Buying Cycle helps us get there.</p>
