      	<h1>The Buying Cycle</h1>
		<br>
          	<p>Is marketing an art or a science?  I think of it as a craft, because it starts with established principles, then creatively applies them to a specific task, the way a carpenter makes a cabinet or a knitter makes a sweater.</p>

			<p>As with any craft, we start by defining a goal -- increase sales, build a brand, reach a new audience, etc.  To develop a strategy to get us to our goal, I use a model I call the Buying Cycle.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="section" id="section2">
          	<p>The Buying Cycle posits that every consumer of every product follows an internal process when they make a purchase decision.  They always begin at one end and, if we do our job (and the product fulfills their needs), they move along the continuum to the other end.  These are the steps:</p>
          	
			<h1>No Awareness.</h1>  
			<p>In the beginning, there is darkness.  Customers don’t know anything about you, or even about your industry.  They just don’t care, because they are not in the market for your product.  </p>
			
			<h1>Awareness.</h1> 
			<p>The customer perceives a need for your product or class of product.  “Huh, I could really use a digital camera.”</p>
			
			<h1>Active Interest.</h1> 
			<p>The customer is now thinking about purchasing a product from you or a competitor.  “I could really use a digital camera NOW.”</p>
			
			<h1>Research.</h1> 
			<p>The customer is interested enough to compare your product to your competitors, with the expectation of making a purchase.</p>
			
			<h1>Trial purchase.</h1> 
			<p>Eureka!  The customer buys something.</p> 
			
			<p>One might think this is the end of the process, but it’s actually the beginning of a new phase.  Now we are trying to move our target from “buyer” to “customer.” </p>
	</div>
	<div class="section" id="section3">
          	<p>I call this phase the “tender time” -- the customer wonders “did I make the right choice?” For smart marketers, it’s the ideal opportunity to build loyalty.  (Your product needs to be good, but how you treat the customer is important too – someone from American Express once told me that their most loyal customers are those who’ve had problems with their cards, because they experience AMEX’s customer service first hand.)</p>

			<p>The next 3 stages are levels of usage and they reflect the loyalty of your customer.  The best way to explain this is through an example:</p>

			<h1>Shared Usage.</h1>  
			<p>Let’s say you sell toothpaste.  At Shared Usage, your customer will buy your toothpaste if it’s cheapest or on sale.</p>

			<h1>Preferred Usage.</h1>  
			<p>At this stage, your customer will buy your toothpaste even if it’s more expensive.</p>

			<h1>Exclusive Usage.</h1>  
			<p>The Holy Grail.  With Exclusive Usage, your customer will buy your brand only.  If the store is out of your toothpaste, they’ll go to another store.</p>

			<p>Cool.  But why do we care?  Because the Buying Cycle helps us create a marketing strategy.  Since customers at different stages in the Buying Cycle care about different things, we need to make sure we give them the information that moves them to the next stage.  </p>

			<p>This is crucial – zillions of marketing dollars are wasted on programs that will never accomplish the goal.  If your objective is to increase sales from existing customers, advertising is a poor choice, for example – there’s too much waste talking to the wrong people.  Someone visiting your web site might be at Research or Active Interest; if so, the site should position your product against your competitors.  </p>

			<p>So take a look at the Buying Cycle chart now – I have mapped marketing elements designed to work at each stage.</p>

			<p>Please note that we may not know where any individual consumer is in the Buying Cycle.  That’s not important for strategizing.  What is important is making sure the customer gets the information they need, when and how they need it.  And the Buying Cycle helps us get there.</p>
