Buying Cycle Copy

If you want to sell something, it’s useful to think about how people buy. Not every product is the same, but generally they follow a series of steps that look like this.

 Copy OK as is, except change “customer” to “consumer”

Tactic: Advertising, content marketing

Active interest
Copy OK as is, except change “customer” to “consumer”

Tactic: Offers, email

Research
Copy OK as is, except change “customer” to “consumer”

Trial Purchase
Change copy to:
Eureka! The consumer buys something. Now begins the “tender time,” when strong cultivation can build “lifetime value” … or risk losing them forever

Tactic: Welcome kit, follow up email

Final box: change it something like this:


		Shared
Usage:	Preferred
		Exclusive

With maybe a bracket or something

Shared usage: The consumer buys your product if it’s on sale. Preferred usage: the consumer buys your product even if the competitor is cheaper, Exclusive usage: consumer will buy your product ONLY
