Website feedback for Fenn

	Overall

	*Homepage looks great, except I am not sure about the color scheme, and if there is not enough distinction between the color areas (add a break with white space, introduce a red hairline or thin divider, something to break up the color chunks which look a bit dated to me. 

	*A lot of the content copy is too small (the intro on the portfolio page, the descriptions of the campaigns, etc, the copy on the cards under “What do you need to do?”) – I can’t read it easily, especially against a color background. The size that works better is on the home page under The Buying cycle – can you use that size instead.

Organization

On the home page, we have the Client List, the MS Society DM and the Buying Cycle. Not sure those are the right things.

	*Client list is OK, but what is there IS the Full client list. Maybe a better approach is to Change the headline on the home page to: Clients include:
	And run a few logos under that, along with the Full Client List box – I can write a little copy to go under the headline that will say something like “I am fortunate to work with highly regarded, smart clients.

	*The logos that would be best here are: The New England Journal, Wellesley College, Habitat for Humanity, Morgan Stanley (shit, they are not on my client list! We need to add them, please put them first), LL Bean, Biogen, if you want to use 6. If you want to use more, use them in this order: Make A Wish, Ritz, Hewlett Packard, The Hartford, BBDO, WBUR. That’s 12, that should be more than enough 

	*Then, when you go to the full client list, the look there is fine, but the logos you’ve included remind me that I have to re-do the client list to be more up to date – so I am going to eliminate and combine categories, which I will include in a separate document. I will also indicate on there what logos I want to use with which categories.

	*I think this allows us to remove the Client List from my resume.

I’m not sure why the MSC DM is on the home page? I thought the idea was to scroll down to answer the questions – that would mean just using that intro copy, along with a small thumbnail to generate some visual interest.

I’ll take a crack at that on a separate document as well – I will write that copy with a headline, and indicate which visual would go with it.


Specific stuff 

	*On the home page: Let’s change “Tell your story” to “Sell something”

	*Buying Cycle: Again, I am going to attach a document with new copy; there will be some specific changes there.

	*One thing I feel we need to do overall here – increase the size of the type in the boxes. 
Also, can you use the technique you can up with to “blend” the colors of the boxes from first to last? The idea here is that this is a blended continuum, rather than discrete or boxed in.
	*Finally, when we reveal the description on the bottom of the boxes (when you click on them), we need to include the tactic from the original chart. I will indicate what goes where on the copy doc.

Portfolio

Mostly, this is OK, but there are places where the heading doesn’t match the content, as I’m sure you know. I also will review this copy, probably re-write and shorten, plus there are some where there isn’t copy – I wrote this and sent it in a previous email, but I will incorporate it all in the attached document.

	*Let’s change “Other Media” to “Branding and other Media.”

As for the branding section: you haven’t done anything for that yet, right?
In the email of June 19, where I had copy rewritten, I provided copy for the branding section.
I want to call that section “The Brand Map” and I will write some more to go with it, but what is in that email is a good place to start.

I am still working on the portfolio overall, but I am going to attach a file for an Outcome Referrals (it’s misspelled on the site now) DM. I would like to feature the insert that says “I will never, ever forget her” and show both the front and the back. If possible, it would be nice to show the front of all the inserts somehow, and include the copy in the “read Copy” section.

I am also going to attach the Olin piece, which I think I already gave you but just to be sure



	*Reasons to hire

	*Overall, I like this, but as I mentioned before, I think the color blocks are too, well, blocky. I think they would work a lot better with some white space and/or so device to break them up. Also, the copy is too small, and I think we ought to be able to scroll through them more quickly – there’s no reason they have to take up this much space. You could put two next to each other, for example, or you could create 8 little boxes that appear on a single screen. They can vary in size if you’d like – I’m thinking of it like a page of choices and the person’s eye goes to wherever it goes.

	*Copy changes
	*On #4: Change headline to: Easy to work with

	*#5: Change last sentence to: When you work with me, you know what your costs will be. I’d rather have a happy client that a few extra bucks.

	*Change the headline on #7 to: High “get it” factor
