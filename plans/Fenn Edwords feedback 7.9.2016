Fenn Edwords feedback 7.9.2016

OK, Fenn, here are my thoughts, piece by piece.

Home page

Really like the overall look! I like the colors, and the mechanics.

On the logo screen, I’d like to make the light green box that holds the logos more opaque or even solid – the typewriter in the background makes it hard to read the logos.

Also on the logos, can we scale them so that they are more consistent size-wise?

I’d like to replace the Hartford with something: NY Life if you can find that, Fidelity if you can’t. BBDO gets lost a bit with the all white logo – is there another version of that (their FB page has it in red)? 

I still don’t get the contents of the home page beneath the client list. Why is the MSC mailing there? Why is the Buying Cycle there? I think if we are going to have this scroll (which we should), maybe the better links are, maybe: About Ed (which could have links to resume and reasons to hire) and Ed’s work (link to portfolio) and maybe Ed’s Process (link to Buying Cycle). Does that make sense to you?

OK, now onto the links from the home page:

Overall, is it possible to make the jump to the intro paragraph land so that the typewriter is lower in the field? As it is, it makes the type hard to see.

Also, is the relative size of the type vs the “see it in action” optimal? I like that the “see it in action” is huge, so I’m only talking about a 10 or 20% change here.

Also, in all four of these, should we include a “back to top” navigation somewhere? Otherwise, people don’t know they can scroll back to the top.

And I wonder if the intro box should have a headline?  I’ll write one for each and we can see how it looks.

Finally, I am not loving the words “see it in action” – let’s change it to “Here’s how”

Sell something/intro box: 
The last two paragraphs don’t belong here, we can just delete them.

Headline: Finding the sweet spot.

Sell something/jump box

 This is fine, except the words say “ads” and we only show one ad – we should either add the second ad (the one with the young man in the coat – that’s Leon Leonwood Bean, by the way) or, if you don’t like that look, change “These ads” to “This ad”

Create a response/intro box:
Let’s cut the last sentence, which I will make into a headline: “Brand advertising that pays for itself.” Please include the quotation marks.

Define your brand/intro box
In the last sentence, please change the beginning to read: My Brand Maps include messages …
Headline: Mapping your brand

Define your brand/jump box
I am struggling with this a bit. I like the NEJM story there, but the intro box talks about the brand map and the jump box shows an ad – a little bit of a disconnect. I think it’s OK to do it like this, but maybe we can include a link to the Brand Map itself (more to come on that later). We could create a hyperlink in the intro box on the words Brand Map. 

I don’t know whether we could or want to add a second link at the bottom of that box titled “Brand Map” (similar to My Portfolio) --- what do you think?

Also, this copy is too long. Use this instead:

Designed to re-connect today’s physician with the New England Journal of Medicine, this campaign unites the Journal’s values with those of physicians. Its visual style places the reader in the ad’s story and signs off with a reader-centric tag line – Never Stop Learning.

Raise money/intro box

Again, I want to shorten this copy, Let’s delete the last sentence in the second paragraph, and pull the third paragraph up to form one paragraph.

Headline: Why do people give away money?

Raise money/jum box
Too long! Let’s use this:
These posters were a collaboration among 38 non-profit groups in Lowell, MA. I named the group, wrote 20 posters, and arranged for pro bono photograph and design. I was honored at a press conference with the mayor of Lowell and received a special award for the work.

Reasons to hire
I really like what you’ve done here! Couple of comments:

The first box (Why should I hire Ed?) should be treated a little differently than the others, I think. As it is, it looks like just another example, and it’s really the intro to the whole section. You could make it a solid box across the entire top or maybe there’s a better solution?

Some of these colors are too dark as a background for black type – the brown, the dark green (whereas the light green, the blue and the taupe work fine). Can you use a lighter value for these? And maybe the body copy type could be slightly larger? Again, small change: 10 or 20%.

Resume
I put this after the Reasons section because the comments are similar – the colors are too dark to read easily, and the type should be larger (maybe a lot larger here, since there is comparatively little copy. Also, I guess I should add THD – let’s put it between 1992-present and the Hill holiday line:

2015-2016  Creative Director, Thompson, Habib, Dennison
		Writer and creative director for Habitat for Humanity, Massachusetts General Hospital, Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada. Also wrote for Feeding America, Make-A-Wish and Mercy Corps

Portfolio
Looks great, still need a number of pieces to be added, and, of course, the thorny issue of the Branding thing. I am not going to make any additional comments here until you finish building this section.

Buying Cycle
I like the mechanic, I’m not sure about the color blend within the boxes – I am concerned that it conveys the wrong message, because the steps are supposed to be self-contained – they don’t bleed into each other. Can you try the color blend, but keep the colors in each box unblended?

Also, the colors themselves – same comment about being too dark. And we definitely shouldn’t begin and end with the same color – let’s use the colors to show the progression from no Awareness to committed customer.

Type in the boxes – too small by a lot – and maybe they should be reversed or something? They look flat to me.

Finally, do we need something to indicate that they need to click on the box to read more?

Client list
This looks fantastic, but there is one issue – if you scroll line by line, the logos get smushed into each other. Can you find a way to keep that from happening? Maybe do the transition behind the white boxes (which you may need to make opaque for it to work). 

If the size of the logos means that you can’t hide the transition, we can use different logos. But these are the best ones, so hopefully it can work.

Blog – don’t forget to figure that one out.

That’s it for now – it’s mostly trivial stuff.
I really think we are almost there!
