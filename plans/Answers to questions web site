Sell something

People make decisions for emotional reasons. Human beings respond better to stories, rather than facts. That’s why I believe that, if you want to sell something to someone, tell them a story. A problem with a solution. A benefit they personally feel. These stories are not easy to identify, or to credibly express. But finding where what your product does dovetails with why the consumer cares is the key to effective marketing.

Define your brand

The power of a brand is nearly incalculable. Every business, large or small, needs to define, articulate and promote their brand.
I work with clients to develop their brand, using a disciplined yet flexible plan revolving around differentiators and core messages. The result is a Brand Map – a document that both supplies content for all consumer-facing materials, and serves as a measuring stick for the future.
An Edwords Brand Map includes messages for ALL your audiences, to ALL your interactions powerful, differentiating and memorable.
