									<h3>Touch</h3>

									<p>Our American black cherry is meticulously sculpted for elegance and integrity, then hand finished with repeated passes of ultrafine sandpaper, 3 coats of slightly heated linseed oil enrich the finish. This craftsmanship ensures that, with care, Thos. Moser furniture will be cherished by both you and your heirs. After all, cherry is scarce—it would be a crime to make something unworthy of it.</p>

									<h3>40,000 Foot Thinking Meets Ground Level Doing</h3>
									
									<p>Traditionally, when it comes to innovation, managers face a yawning chasm between generating big ideas and getting real work accomplished. At MIT Sloan Management Review, we bridge the gap between great thoughts and great results.</p>
									<p>Especially now, since we’ve thoroughly re-imagined and re-designed both our print edition and our web site. Even if you’re familiar with MIT SMR, you’ll discover that we are now focused on innovation—leading change, fostering creative thinking, and building an innovative culture. And as you’d expect from MIT, you’ll find innovation that works, that results in a tangible result, that’s a little different from what anyone else is saying or doing. </p>

									<p>Every morning…rain, snow or shine…I get up early, stumble into some warm clothes, and take my dog for a walk in the woods. It’s great exercise, and we’ve seen some magnificent sunrises. But the real pleasure is watching my dog. She loves to run around, chase squirrels, hunt field mice. You can just tell she feels part of the woods, part of nature. And when I’m cooped up at the office all day, a little nature stays with me too.</p>

									<p>When I was growing up, you rode a 10-speed, took long road trips, and pedaled furiously all day. Now, it’s more relaxed. The kids and I take it slow, poking around those old dirt roads. It’s real quiet and the air smells fresh and clean. We’ve even snuck up on a deer now and then. Plus, it’s nice to get out and do something special with my children.</p>

									<p>I’ve fished a lot of places on this river, but I’ve always had the best luck right here. Maybe it’s the temperature of this water, maybe it’s the currents, but I’ve caught fish even when the local experts say they aren’t taking. It’s so peaceful, so still. I’d come here even if I never caught another fish, or at least that’s what I tell myself when I’m not catching any.</p>

									<h3>Food for Thought campaign sample letter</h3>
									<h4>Envelope</h4>
									<p>Food for thought: Your $75 pledge to WBUR is less than $.20 per day ... less than a daily newspaper</p>
									<h4>Letter cover</h4>
									<p>More food for thought: With your help right now, you’ll hear more news on WBUR all year round.</p>
									<h4>Letter copy</h4>
									<p>Dear WBUR Supporter,</p>
									<p>As a supporter of WBUR, you may have noticed something new during the last year—less on-air fundraising.</p>
									<p>During the past year, we reduced our on-air fundraising significantly…including cutting our most recent fundraiser from 10 days down to 4!</p>
									<p>In the coming year, we will do even more. For example, with your help, we intend to eliminate next summer’s fundraiser entirely. And we hope to reduce the length of our 2 remaining on-air fundraisers…starting by shortening the upcoming fall fundraiser by 25%.</p>
									<p>We can do so only with your help. To reduce the fundraisers, we need to increase the amount of money we raise through the mail. Which is why I hope we can count on your to make an additional pledge now.</p>
									<p>Keep in mind that WBUR really is a bargain, compared to any other news source you can name. Newspapers? If you get a paper every day, you probably spend about $200 per year. Cable TV? Generally about $40 per month. And, while other radio stations don’t charge you directly, you still pay for their programming in the form of commercials—over 180 hours per year, if you listen 2 hours per day.</p>
									<blockquote><p>Only WBUR brings you commercial-free, in-depth news 17 hours every weekday. Only WBUR brings you in-depth news anywhere you are—your car, your kitchen, your portable stereo, anywhere. And only WBUR lets you decide how much to pay for the service you depend on—$75, $100, $150, whatever you think it’s worth.</p></blockquote>
									<p>Don’t forget: for your pledge of $150, you’ll receive 2 tickets to “Food for Thought,” our NPR Brunch at 12 Noon on December 4th at the Sheraton Boston.</p>
									<p>Featuring Scott Simon, Robert Siegel and Mara Liasson, “Food for Thought” is a unique opportunity to hear inside information and entertaining tidbits from 3 of NPR’s most popular personalities. Tickets are $75 each.</p>
									<p>You’ll have a wonderful time— and support WBUR in the process. Let me remind you, however—this event always sells out, so order your tickets now to avoid missing out.</p>
									<p>This is your last chance to pledge and reduce the length of the on-air fundraiser! I hope we can count on you to help us bring you more news— and less fundraising—all year round.</p>
									<p>Sincerely,</p>
									<p>Jane Christo,</p>
									<p>General Manager, WBUR</p>
									<p>P.S. Your contribution goes even farther when you participate in a corporate matching program. Please see your company’s human resources department for details.</p>
									<h3>Myth/Reality campaign sample letter</h3>
									<h4>Envelope</h4>
									<p>Myth: “It doesn’t matter when I pledge.”</p>
									<h4>Letter</h4>
									<p>Reality: “When you pledge now, you’ll help reduce our on-air fundraising for a full year.”</p>
									<p>Dear WBUR Supporter:</p>
									<p>It has been a year since your last pledge to WBUR, so I thought I’d take this opportunity to thank you for your past contribution…and to remind you how your support of the station translates directly into more in-depth news and information for you.</p>
									<p>Actually, your renewed commitment to WBUR is particularly important right now. Because with your help, we can continue a significant recent trend—less on-air fundraising.</p>
									<p>As a result, you hear more in-depth news and information on WBUR—a direct result of, among other things, your response to our mailers.</p>
									<p>We’d like to continue this trend. You can help make it happen, by renewing your support for WBUR through the mail today.</p>
									<p>Your support now will help us continue the outstanding news programs you count on from WBUR. Including a variety of important improvements we have made:</p>
									<blockquote>
										<ol><li>More news. You hear more news and information on WBUR throughout the day. Including more news from National Public Radio (NPR) than on any other station in Boston (for example, WBUR now brings you three full hours of <u>All Things Considered</u> each weekday, now beginning at 4 PM). So you can count on WBUR for news, day or night.</li>
										<li>New Programs. <u>The Connection</u> with Chris Lydon has been a highly-acclaimed success. In fact, <u>The Connection</u> has been so successful that we will bring you a special edition each Monday night until November, featuring election covereage from Chris and the NPR news team. We have also expanded <u>Only A Game</u> to a full hour, and we’ve added <u>Monitor Radio</u>, <u>Marketplace</u>, and <u>Weekly Edition</u>, the best of NPR news.</li>
										<li>Other programs you won’t hear anywhere else. For example, only WBUR brings you <u>Weekend Edition</u>…<u>Fresh Air</u>…<u>Car Talk</u>…<u>Talk of the Nation</u>…and five broadcasts every weekday from the BBC. If you didn’t hear these programs on WBUR, you wouldn’t’ hear them anywhere.</li>
										<li>Less on-air fundraising.  While our expenses have risen as we have expanded our news programs, we have drastically slashed our fundraising. We’re committed to continuing this trend—but we need your help to succeed again.</li></ol>
									</blockquote>
									<p>WBUR offers the most comprehensive in-depth news you’ll find anywhere. Your pledge right now not only helps us to continue bringing you the news, but also helps reduce the on-air fundraising you hear.</p>
									<p>We have also created a special gift, available for a limited time through this mailer only, to thank you for renewing your commitment to WBUR:</p>
								<blockquote>It’s a specially designed beach towel, measuring a full 36” x 70”. Made from 100% cotton, it is emblazoned with a colorful design featuring the WBUR logo. This one-of-a-kind gift is yours with thanks for your pledge of $125. (Please reply by June 20, so you don’t miss out.)</blockquote>
								<p>But whether you decide to accept this gift or not, please remember—we’re counting on our contributing listeners to make our reduction in on-air fundraising a success. As always with WBUR, the success and future of this station are in your hands.</p>
								<p>You have been there for us in the past. Please be there again now.</p>
								<p>Thank you in advance for your renewed support.</p>
								<p>Cordially,</p>
								<p>Jane Christo</p>
								<p>General Manager, WBUR</p>

				<p>As a new school that takes a revolutionary approach to educating engineers, Olin turns the usual fundraising method on its head; rather than focusing on the appeal, they can succeed by reinforcing the mission. This “emergency” fundraiser, almost entirely mission-focused, still reached its goal within its first week.</p>

								<p>Dear [First Name],</p>
								<p>As the incoming Chair of Annual Giving, I’d like to take a moment to explain why I support Wellesley as both a donor and a volunteer.</p>
								<p>Wellesley opened the entire world for me. I arrived on campus as a naive young woman from Oklahoma. At Wellesley, my professors and classmates challenged me to believe that I could do anything I wanted. Even today, when I hit a roadblock, I re-visit that “Wellesley place” in my mind and find inspiration, strength, and a “get-it-done” attitude.</p>
								<p>As an alumna, I support Wellesley today so that other young women may have a similar experience, to be empowered to pursue their dreams and to make a difference. For example, consider what these current students have accomplished:</p>
								<ul><li>*Linnea Herzog ’12 organized a book collection for libraries in Turkmenistan and Philadelphia inner city schools.</li>
								<li>*Phoebe Hanlder ’12 actively participated in and co-authored an NIH-funded cancer study.</li>
								<li>*Roshan Alemi ’12 interned at the Center for Sustainable Development in Iran, an NGO that assists nomads.</li></ul>
								<p>The success of young women like these benefits us all. They are making a difference, which both reinforces the strength of the Wellesley network and reaffirms the value of our Wellesley education. Our support of Wellesley through Annual Giving paves the way.</p>
								<p>Today, I am asking you to renew your support of Annual Giving, which has a direct impact on students:</p>
								<ul><li>*Annual Giving allows Wellesley to offer generous financial aid, maintain a “need blind” admission policy, and in turn attract the most deserving students.</li>
								<li>*Ongoing financial strength allows Wellesley to nurture its intellectual community, the cornerstone of academic excellence.</li></ul>
								<p>One last point: alumnae support made it possible for us to attend Wellesley, whether or not we received financial aid. That’s because the true cost of a Wellesley education is much higher than what students pay in tuition (currently, about 62% higher). The gap is closed by sources like Annual Giving. So by supporting Annual Giving, we are “repaying” those alumnae who were there for us. It is a Wellesley tradition that has gone on for many generations.</p>
								<p>Thank you for being generous last year. Please take this opportunity to once again help Wellesley educate the next generation of women who will make a difference in the world.</p>
								<p>(signature)</p>
								<p>Sandra Yeager ’86</p>
								<p>Chair, Annual Giving</p>
								<p>P.S. Wellesley students are accomplishing extraordinary things every day. Let’s change the lives of today’s students!</p>

								<h4>Furniture for all your senses.</h4>
								<p>Your hand is inexorably drawn to the sumptuous finish. You hear the sure, squeak-free “thunk” of loving craftsmanship. The cherry wood’s aroma enriches your home. Beautiful? Of course. But not for your eyes alone.</p>
								<h3>Touch</h3>
								<h4>Love at first touch.</h4>
								<p>Lovingly crafted furniture that nourishes your world. Imagine your hand lingering on its painstakingly hewn cherry frame. Extraordinary to look at,  restorative to sit on, inquiring to live with, utterly gratifying to own.</p>
								<h3>Tree</h3>
								<h4>With care, this chair will outlast the tree it’s made from.</h4>
								<p>Our American black cherry is meticulously sculpted for elegance and integrity, then hand finished with repeated passes of ultrafine sandpaper, 3 coats of slightly heated linseed oil enrich the finish. This craftsmanship ensures that, with care, Thos. Moser furniture will be cherished by both you and your heirs. After all, cherry is scarce—it would be a crime to make something unworthy of it.</p>

								<h3>40,000 Foot Thinking Meets Ground Level Doing</h3>
								
								<p>Traditionally, when it comes to innovation, managers face a yawning chasm between generating big ideas and getting real work accomplished. At MIT Sloan Management Review, we bridge the gap between great thoughts and great results.</p>
								<p>Especially now, since we’ve thoroughly re-imagined and re-designed both our print edition and our web site. Even if you’re familiar with MIT SMR, you’ll discover that we are now focused on innovation—leading change, fostering creative thinking, and building an innovative culture. And as you’d expect from MIT, you’ll find innovation that works, that results in a tangible result, that’s a little different from what anyone else is saying or doing. </p>
								<p>See for yourself. Visit us at sloanreview.mit.edu. And see what happens when thinking it up meets getting it done</p>

								<p>Every morning…rain, snow or shine…I get up early, stumble into some warm clothes, and take my dog for a walk in the woods. It’s great exercise, and we’ve seen some magnificent sunrises. But the real pleasure is watching my dog. She loves to run around, chase squirrels, hunt field mice. You can just tell she feels part of the woods, part of nature. And when I’m cooped up at the office all day, a little nature stays with me too.</p>

								<p>When I was growing up, you rode a 10-speed, took long road trips, and pedaled furiously all day. Now, it’s more relaxed. The kids and I take it slow, poking around those old dirt roads. It’s real quiet and the air smells fresh and clean. We’ve even snuck up on a deer now and then. Plus, it’s nice to get out and do something special with my children.</p>

								<p>I’ve fished a lot of places on this river, but I’ve always had the best luck right here. Maybe it’s the temperature of this water, maybe it’s the currents, but I’ve caught fish even when the local experts say they aren’t taking. It’s so peaceful, so still. I’d come here even if I never caught another fish, or at least that’s what I tell myself when I’m not catching any.</p>

								<h3>Intro spread</h3>
								<p>H: Chief Residents help their colleagues learn and succeed.</p>
								<p>The Journal can help.</p>
								<p>At the New England Journal of Medicine, our goal is to be a lifelong learning companion for physicians. We publish the studies that make worldwide headlines, as well as review articles, cases, and clinical content that help physicians improve clinical care. In addition, many of the services we provide are designed to help physicians learn and teach. As a Chief Resident, you will find many of these features invaluable—some of the most notable examples are described on the pages that follow.</p>
								<p>As a participant in the NEJM Chief Resident Program, you are entitled to free and unlimited access to all these features. You can find more information about them at nejm.org/features.</p>
								<p>Best wishes for a successful year as Chief Resident!</p>
								<h3>Videos spread</h3>
								<p>When you need to: Demonstrate a procedure</p>
								<p>Turn to NEJM for: Videos in Clinical Medicine</p>
								<p>Chief Residents find that the Journal’s Videos in Clinical Medicine make it easy to demonstrate common clinical procedures. Peer-reviewed for accuracy and chaptered for easy reference, these videos show every step of the procedure. Videos in Clinical Medicine are available for the topics shown here. New videos are added regularly. PDF summaries of procedures are available for download.</p>
								<h3>Image Challenge spread</h3>
								<p>When you need to: Improve visual recognition of symptoms</p>
								<p>Turn to NEJM for: Image Challenge</p>
								<p>The newly re-designed Image Challenge is a valuable tool for honing diagnostic skills. With Image Challenge, users are presented with a new image each week, and asked for a diagnosis. Users can check their answers immediately, and also see how others chose. There is also a gallery of previously highlighted images to choose from. Image Challenge is an extremely useful way to develop your colleagues’ diagnostic acumen.</p>

				<h2>Value Proposition</h2>
				<p>What you will deliver to your customer? Consistency and customer-focus are crucial.</p>

				<h2>Unique Selling Proposition</h2>
				<p>What differentiates you? Think “Volvo=safety” What do you equal?</p>

				<h2>Tag Line</h2>
				<p>Label? Emotional Driver? Rallying Cry? I’ll show you how each might work.</p>

				 <h2>Messages</h2>
				<p>Of all the things you COULD say, what SHOULD you say? How should you say it? We will develop the 5 key messages.</p>

				<h2>Message by audience</h2>
				<p>You have your topline message. How should it be flavored for different constituents?</p>

				<h2>Elevator pitch</h2>
				<p>Can you say it in 30 seconds? Do you say it the same way every time? Does everyone in the organization? An often overlooked branding opportunity.</p>

				<p>One of my most rewarding projects, these posters were a collaboration among 38 non-profit groups in Lowell, MA.

They were featured in a press conference hosted by the mayor of Lowell, and I was a guest on a local radio station to promote the effort.  I also received a special award for the work.</p>

								<p>Who We Help: A Profile</p>
								<p>Tricia is a Pioneer</p>
								<p>Although she suffers from cerebral palsy, she attended Lowell Public Schools from start to finish—the first disabled person to do so.</p>
								<p>She was the first person in her family to earn a college degree. Then a Master’s Degree.</p>
								<p>Ever the pioneer, Tricia now helps recruit girls for non-traditional trades at a Greater Lowell Technical High School.</p>
								<p>Tricia attended the Project Genesis home buyer training seminars offered by the Merrimack Valley Housing Partnership.</p>
								<p>Which helped her become the first person in her family to own her own home.</p>
								<p>Want to find out more about MVHP? Ask Tricia. She’s at Lowell Tech, helping other young girls find their way—one pioneer to another.</p>
								<p>“I am proud of what I did.”</p>
								<p>“When I was raped, I had a choice to make. Was I going to let him get away with it? Would I be able to go through the whole legal process without breaking down or giving up?</p>
								<p>When I heard the word “guilty,” I cried. It was me who took this rapist off the streets. It was me who had saved maybe one person from being violated by this man. It was me protecting my daughter from him and others like him. It was me who did something that would eventually take away my nightmares and my fears. It was me who realized that I was worthwhile: a good and decent person.</p>
								<p>I am proud of what I did…It was difficult but I would do it again because I can feel safe now.”</p>
								<p>Rape Crisis Services of Greater Lowell is proud to have helped this survivor heal her mind, body, and spirit. We offer free counseling and advocacy to all survivors of sexual violence, and are here to support you whether or not you decide to report to the police.</p>
								<p>Tran just wouldn’t give up.</p>
								<p>He was failing 7th grade for the second time. He hated school because he thought the teachers stared at him.</p>
								<p>And he had a secret. He couldn’t hear very well. Or see correctly. But he was ashamed to tell anyone.</p>
								<p>So he mastered lip-reading. And got himself through school without his secret being discovered.</p>
								<p>Through multiple visits with the school, the teacher, and his parents, ONE Lowell helped this intelligent young man receive his accurate diagnosis and proper treatment.</p>
								<p>For now, he sits in the front of his classroom so he can see better, and his teachers face him directly so he can read their lips. A hearing aid and glasses are on their way.</p>
								<p>Results? Straight A’s on his last report card…a nearly perfect attendance record…and plans for college.</p>
								<p>It’s what happens when someone takes the time and effort to care.</p>
								<p>Joy had nothing to her name.</p>
								<p>She came from an abusive situation. She had no money. No furniture.</p>
								<p>Nothing more than the clothes on her back and a small suitcase.</p>
								<p>The Caleb Foundation got Joy an apartment.</p>
								<p>Helped arrange for a donation of a bed, and a few dishes.</p>
								<p>Now Joy has a job…a place to live…and lots of plans.</p>
								<p>The Caleb Group provides decent, safe housing for the low income residents of Lowell. Then we help residents to set and reach economic self-sufficiency goals.</p>
								<p>We’re pleased to have given Joy what she needed—a fresh start. After all, as Joy says, “Everyone needs a place of their own.”</p>
