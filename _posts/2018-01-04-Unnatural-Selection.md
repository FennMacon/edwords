## Why Darwin Would Be A Great Copywriter

My favorite scientific theory is Natural Selection.

Rather than go too far down the rabbit hole of what it says about me that I HAVE a favorite scientific theory, I’ll just say that I admire this theory for three reasons:
1)	Any moron can understand it. 
2)	It’s incredibly simple and elegant
3)	It’s logically unassailable

_I don't know nuthin about Natural Selection, but a longer neck would be super-handy_

Reasons #1 is crucial: Newton’s third law of motion and Einstein’s E=MC2 are both elegant and simple, but to truly understand them, you need to know the math. But natural selection? Once you accept that genes are a) responsible for your body and its attendant structures being the way they are, and b) heredity, you just can’t argue with natural selection. It’s brain-dead simple – you have a characteristic that makes you more successful evolutionarily, you pass it on to your offspring and, given enough generations, those that have the trait survive and breed, and the ones that lack it don’t. The logic is flawless, there are no exceptions, and, as I said, any moron can understand it.

But as much as I love natural selection, I think its universal applicability is causing serious harm to marketing communications (well, frankly, to all human culture in general, but I should start small).

_I'm King of the World! Wait, how do I get down?_

Here’s how.

Imagine I am a creative director looking to hire a writer. What do I look for? If I am like most creative directors (and I am), I am an arrogant SOB who thinks that I pretty much invented effective copy, and that any other possible approach or style or voice or whatever is inferior to mine (yeah, OK, guilty as charged).

_Sure, we could do it your way. But ... why?_

So I hire that person, the one with the “Mini Me” of books.

And eventually, given enough time, natural selection occurs and ALL communications starts to look and sound alike.
